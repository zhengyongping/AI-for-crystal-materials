            "\n",
            "Graphdiyne (GDY) is a novel two-dimensional carbon allotrope that has garnered extensive attention in material science and spintronics due to its unique electronic and magnetic properties. Originally proposed in 1997, and synthesized in its γ-variant in 2010, GDY features a distinct carbon matrix characterized by sp-hybridization, which contributes to its electronic properties and potential applications in various technological fields such as energy conversion and storage. This report compiles current findings on the magnetism properties of graphdiyne, with a focus on its intrinsic magnetic behaviors and the effects of doping and structural modifications.\n",
            "\n",
            "## Intrinsic Magnetic Properties\n",
            "\n",
            "Pristine graphdiyne demonstrates paramagnetic behavior, characterized by a saturation moment of 0.51 emu·g⁻¹ at 2 K. This paramagnetism is attributed to the unique arrangements of carbon atoms that disrupt delocalized π-electronic systems, facilitating the emergence of local magnetic moments. Initial theoretical models indicated that intrinsic structural features of graphdiyne could give rise to magnetic phenomena, suggesting the potential for engineering its characteristics through material manipulation.\n",
            "\n",
            "## Transition Metal Doping\n",
            "\n",
            "### Doping with Transition Metals\n",
            "\n",
            "Transition metal (TM) doping, particularly with iron (Fe), cobalt (Co), and nickel (Ni), has been identified as an effective strategy to induce ferromagnetism in graphdiyne. Experimental investigations have shown that:\n",
            "\n",
            "- **Fe-Doped Graphdiyne (Fe-GDY)**: Exhibits robust room-temperature ferromagnetism, with a saturation magnetization of 2.86 emu·g⁻¹. Notable magnetic behavior was observed, characterized by well-defined hysteresis loops at both 5 K and 300 K. DFT calculations indicated a kagome lattice structure formed by the doped Fe atoms, which enhances the material’s magnetic properties.\n",
            "\n",
            "- **Co-Doped Graphdiyne (Co-GDY)**: Demonstrates significant local magnetic moments, yielding a Curie temperature above room temperature (approximately 350 K) and a coercive field of 78 Oe at 300 K. These findings emphasize the material's potential for spintronic applications.\n",
            "\n",
            "- **Ni-Doped Graphdiyne (Ni-GDY)**: Exhibited a saturation magnetization of 1.04 emu·g⁻¹ at 5 K, indicating a lesser magnetic response compared to its Fe and Co counterparts.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Synthesis and Engineering Methods\n",
            "\n",
            "Recent advancements in synthesis techniques have further propelled the development of ferromagnetic graphdiyne. The improvement of synthesis methods, such as liquid-liquid interface synthesis, allows for controlled doping, enabling homogenous integration of transition metals into the GDY structure. This level of control is critical for achieving desired magnetic behaviors while maintaining excellent electronic properties.\n",
            "\n",
            "Post-synthesis modifications, such as annealing, have also been explored. For instance, Co-GDY annealed at 500°C exhibited optimal room-temperature ferromagnetism with a saturation magnetization of 0.26 emu·g⁻¹, underscoring the influence of thermal treatments on magnetic characteristics.\n",
            "\n",
            "## Other Doping Strategies\n",
            "\n",
            "In addition to transition metal doping, the introduction of light elements like nitrogen and halogens has been shown to significantly impact the magnetic properties of GDY:\n",
            "\n",
            "- **Nitrogen Doping**: The incorporation of nitrogen atoms enhances the paramagnetism of graphdiyne, increasing the local magnetic moments due to changes in the density of states. Therefore, nitrogen-doped GDY (N-GDY) emerges as a promising candidate for exhibits improved magnetic performance.\n",
            "\n",
            "- **Fluorine Doping**: Specifically, fluorine-doped graphdiyne (FsGDY) has been noted for its remarkable ferromagnetic characteristics. Fluorine functionalization enhances charge transfer properties while establishing a ferromagnetic coupling at temperatures below 16 K. The mobility of FsGDY reaches up to 320 cm²/V·s, reinforcing its potential for spintronic applications.\n",
            "\n",
            "## Theoretical Modeling\n",
            "\n",
            "Theoretical frameworks, including density functional theory (DFT) and Monte Carlo simulations, have been instrumental in understanding the underlying magnetic mechanisms within graphdiyne. These studies have revealed how various structural configurations, such as the kagome lattice resulting from transition metal doping, contribute to electronic properties and ferromagnetism. \n",
            "\n",
            "Research employing the Ising model has further illustrated the magnetic and thermodynamic properties of graphdiyne-like structures, indicating complex behaviors such as mixed spin interactions and compensation phenomena. \n",
            "\n",
            "## Conclusion\n",
            "\n",
            "Graphdiyne presents a compelling case as a 2D carbon semiconductor with versatile magnetic properties that can be tailored through doping and engineering methods. Intrinsic paramagnetism can be effectively transformed into robust ferromagnetism via transition metal doping and careful material modifications. With enhanced magnetic behaviors observed in TM-doped and fluorine-modified versions, graphdiyne shows significant promise for applications in spintronics and beyond. Continued exploration of synthesis methods and structural modifications will be vital in unlocking the full potential of graphdiyne as a functional material in future technologies.\n"
